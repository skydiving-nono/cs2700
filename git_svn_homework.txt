-What was the commit message of revision 7? Show how you found out.
To find out, first I did 
'svn checkout http://svn.cactuscode.org/flesh/trunk/src/'
to download the repository. 
Next I ran 'svn log --revision 7' to see the revision data of revision 7, including the commit message.

The commit message is "Basic structure now implemented. Still needs all the code behind the skeleton."

-Which revision removed the macro GROUP_SCALAR? (mentioned in the commit message)
Revision #1839 removed the macro GROUP_SCALAR

-Do a checkout and an export of that repository. Report about the size of both. Which one is larger and why? Which version of svn are you using?
Checkout size: 5.2M
Export size: 2.5M

The checkout size is larger because it includes all of the previous versions while export gets a particular revision, namely the latest revision.

I am using svn version 1.7.10. (command: svn --version)
